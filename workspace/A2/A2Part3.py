A2-Part-3: Implement the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)

Write a function that implements the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Given a sequence x of length
N, the function should return its DFT, its spectrum of length N with the frequency indexes ranging from 0 
to N-1.

The input argument to the function is a numpy array x and the function should return a numpy array X which 
is of the DFT of x.

EXAMPLE: If you run your function using x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]), the function shoulds return the following numpy array:
array([10.0 + 0.0j,  -2. +2.0j,  -2.0 - 9.79717439e-16j, -2.0 - 2.0j])

Note that you might not get an exact 0 in the output because of the small numerical errors due to the
limited precision of the data in your computer. Usually these errors are of the order 1e-15 depending
on your machine.
