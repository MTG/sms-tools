It takes an input audio file and uses the function `sineModel.sineModelAnal()`, tracks the mainlobes of the two sinusoids to obtain the two frequency tracks (`fTrackEst`) in the signal. It also computes the estimation error (`meanErr`) in frequency using the true frequency tracks obtained using `genTrueFreqTracks()`.\n",

The output is the set of parameters you used: `window`, `t`, the time stamps, estimated and the true frequency tracks.
