The sampling rate is the number of samples obtained in one second when sampling a continuous analog signal to a discrete digital signal. As mentioned earlier, most of the time we will be working with wav audio files that have a sampling rate of 44100 Hz, which is a typical value. For some applications, changing the sampling rate of an audio signal can be necessary. This optional part shows how to do this, from a higher sampling rate to a lower one.\n",

To create a wav audio file from an array, you can use the `wavwrite` function from the `utilFunctions` module. Be careful with the sampling rate parameter since it should be different from that of the original audio."
