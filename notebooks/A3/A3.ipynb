    "Given a signal consisting of two sinusoids, write a function that selects the first `M` samples from the signal and returns the positive half of the DFT magnitude spectrum (in dB), such that it has only two non-zero values. \n",
    "\n",
    "`M` is to be calculated as the smallest positive integer for which the positive half of the DFT magnitude spectrum has only two non-zero values. To get the positive half of the spectrum, first compute the `M` point DFT of the input signal (for this you can use the `fft` function of `scipy.fftpack`, which is already imported in this script). Consider only the first `(M/2)+1` samples of the DFT and compute the magnitude spectrum of the positive half (in dB) as `mX = 20*log10(abs(X[:M/2+1]))`, where `X` is the DFT of the input.\n",

    "The input arguments to this function are the input signal `x` (of length `W >= M`) consisting of two sinusoids of frequency `f1` and `f2`, the sampling frequency `fs` and the value of frequencies `f1` and `f2`. The function should return the positive half of the magnitude spectrum `mX`. For this question, you can assume the input frequencies `f1` and `f2` to be positive integers and factors of `fs`, and that `M` is even. \n",

    "Due to the precision of the FFT computation, the zero values of the DFT are not zero but very small values < 1e-12 (or -240 dB) in magnitude. For practical purposes, all values with absolute value less than 1e-6 (or -120 dB) can be considered to be zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: The DFT magnitude spectrum of a sinusoid has only one non-zero value (in the positive half of the DFT spectrum) when its frequency coincides with one of the DFT bin frequencies. This happens when the DFT size (`M` in this question) contains exactly an integer number of periods of the sinusoid. Since the signal in this question consists of two sinusoids, this condition should hold true for each of the sinusoids, so that the DFT magnitude spectrum has only two non-zero values, one per sinusoid. \n",
