    "# Exercise 4: Short-time Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this exercise you will learn about the concept of the main lobe width of the spectrum of a window and you will better understand the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). You will also use the STFT to extract basic rhythm related information from an audio signal, implementing an onset detection function, which is one of the rhythm descriptors often used in music information retrieval to detect onsets of acoustic events. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four parts in this exercise. 1) Extracting the main lobe of the spectrum of a window, 2) Measuring noise in the reconstructed signal using the STFT model, 3) Computing band-wise energy envelopes of a signal, 4) Computing an onset detection function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "__Main lobe of the spectrum of a window:__\n",
    "The width of the main lobe of the magnitude spectrum of a window is an important characteristic used in deciding which window type is best for the analysis of an audio excerpt. There exists a tradeoff between the main lobe width and the side lobe attenuation. Typically for windows with a narrower main lobe, the side lobes are less attenuated. \n",
    "An interesting fact is that changing the length of a window $M$ doesn't affect the main lobe width of the spectrum of the window in samples. Note that if you use zero-padding for computing the spectrum of a window, the main lobe width will be multiplied by the zero-padding factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):__\n",
    "An efficient way to compute the discrete Fourier transform of a signal is the fast Fourier transform, FFT. The FFT algorithm  factorizes the DFT matrix in order to exploit the symmetries in the DFT equation. FFT computation is specially very efficient when the FFT size is a power of 2. Therefore, whenever possible we use an FFT size that is a power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Energy of a signal:__ The energy of a signal $x[n]$ of length $N$ can be computed in the discrete time domain as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E=\\overset{N-1}{\\underset{n=0}{\\sum}}\\left|x\\left[n\\right]\\right|^{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "__Energy in a frequency band:__ Given the DFT spectrum of the signal $X[k]$, the energy $E$ in a specific frequency band spanning the bin index $k_1$ to $k_2$ can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E=\\overset{k_{2}}{\\underset{k=k_{1}}{\\sum}}\\left|X\\left[k\\right]\\right|^{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this computation the $X[k]$ values are not in decibels (dB). The `stftAnal()` function returns magnitude spectra in dB scale, which should be converted to linear scale before the energy computation. Once the energy is computed it can be converted back to the dB scale as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{dB}= 20\\,\\log_{10}(E)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "__Signal to noise ratio (SNR):__\n",
    "Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a frequently used measure to quantify the amount of noise present/added in a signal. In the context of this exercise it can be computed in decibels (dB) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{SNR} = 20\\,\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{signal}}}{E_{\\mathrm{noise}}}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $E_{\\mathrm{signal}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{noise}}$ are the energy of the signal and noise respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case of analysis and synthesis using a specific model (for example, STFT) noise can be thought of as the difference between the input signal and the output signal of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Onset detection function:__\n",
    "An onset detection function (ODF) refers to a continuous function (one value per audio frame) often used for detecting acoustic events in an audio stream. In music information retrieval (MIR), ODFs are typically used for detecting onsets of musical notes and percussion strokes. An ODF generally has high values at the onsets of acoustic events. A simple ODF can be computed by taking the difference between the energy values of consecutive frames, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "O(l) = E(l) - E(l-1) ,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, l \\geq 1\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $O(l)$ is the ODF computed at frame index $l$ and $E$ is the energy of the signal in a particular frequency band in decibels (dB). Often, multiple ODFs are computed with different frequency bands across the spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to detect only the onsets of the events and not the offsets, it is a common practice to half wave rectify the ODF and obtain $\\bar{O}(l)$. Half wave rectification of the ODF is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    " \\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\bar{O}(l)=\\begin{cases}\n",
    " \\begin{array}{c}\n",
    " O(l), \\, \\mathrm{if} \\,\\,O(l)>0\\\\\n",
    " \\,\\,\\,\\,0, \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{if} \\,\\, O(l)\\leq0\n",
    " \\end{array}\\end{cases} \n",
