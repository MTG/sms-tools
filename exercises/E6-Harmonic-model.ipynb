    "# Assignment 6: Harmonic model\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise on the Harmonic model will help you better understand the issue of fundamental frequency ($f_0$) estimation by analyzing several sound examples with harmonic content. There are four parts to this exercise: 1) Estimate fundamental frequency, $f_0$, in an polyphonic audio file, 2) Segmentation of stable note regions in an audio signal using $f_0$, 3) Compute amount of inharmonicity present in a sound, and 4) Improving the implementation of the two way mismatch $f_0$ estimation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "__Harmonic model parameters:__ The Harmonic model is used for the analysis of harmonic sounds. The file `harmonicModel.py` provides the code for Harmonic model analysis and synthesis. The key component of the harmonic model is the estimation of the fundamental frequency ($f_0$) and its harmonics. Apart from parameters that have been covered in previous exercises, such as the window, FFT size or the peak picking threshold, we have a few additional parameters used by the harmonic model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `nH`: maximum number of harmonics to be used in the analysis.\n",
    "2. `maxf0`: maximum $f_0$ frequency in Hz to be considered. \n",
    "3. `minf0`: minimum $f_0$ frequency in Hz to be considered. Setting the `maxf0` and `minf0` accurately help to narrow down the $f_0$ candidates used by TWM algorithm and lead to better $f_0$ estimation. \n",
    "4. `f0et`: error threshold in the $f_0$ detection. This is the maximum error allowed in the TWM algorithm. If the TWM mismatch error is larger than `f0et`, no $f_0$ is detected and the TWM algorithm returns $f_0 = 0$ for the frame. \n",
    "5. `harmDevSlope`: slope of harmonic deviation allowed in the estimated harmonic frequency, compared to a perfect harmonic frequency. This is used to compute the threshold to generate the harmonics. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Melody representation:__ For computational analysis, melody is represented typically by the pitch (fundamental frequency). The fundamental frequency ($f_0$) is usually estimated in $Hz$ but for a musically meaningful representation, we convert $f_0$ from Hz to Cent. Cent is a logarithmic scale computed as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:HztoCent}\n",
    "f_{0,\\mathrm{Cents}}=1200\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{f_{0,\\mathrm{Hz}}}{55.0}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a tuning frequency of A4 = 440 Hz, the reference frequency used in the Cent scale is the frequency of the note A1 = 55Hz, i.e. 55Hz = 0 Cent. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Segmentation and transcription:__\n",
    "Audio segmentation and transcription are two important music information retrieval tasks. Audio segmentation aims to segment the audio into musically meaningful entities. Music Transcription aims to automatically obtain a score-like representation from a music audio piece. Segmentation is often a preprocessing step in transcription. Both these tasks have several different approaches that have been explored. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will consider a simple approach to note level segmentation of melodies. Given the audio file, we first estimate the pitch (fundamental frequency $f_0$) for the whole file. We then segment the pitch contour into stable regions. The stable regions most likely correspond to notes of the melody. We then have the start and end time stamps of each note played in the melody. A limitation of this approach to segmentation is that it might not work for notes with a vibrato. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will only implement the segmentation as described above. However, additionally for each segment, given a tuning frequency (say A = 440 Hz), you can obtain the notes played in the melody by quantizing the pitch in each segment to a note - a note level transcription of the melody. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Inharmonicity:__ In music, inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of the partials depart from integer multiples of the fundamental frequency (harmonic series). An ideal, homogeneous, infinitesimally thin or infinitely flexible string or column of air has exactly harmonic modes of vibration. However, in any real musical instrument, the resonant body that produces the music tone - typically a string, wire, or column of air—deviates from this ideal and has some small or large amount of inharmonicity. You can read more about inharmonicity at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inharmonicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of an instrument that exhibits inharmonicity is the piano. For the piano, several models have been proposed to obtain the partials of the piano, which can be used to estimate the inharmonicity. One of the models proposed by Fletcher (Harvey Fletcher, \"Normal Vibration Frequencies of a Stiff Piano String\", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 36, 203 (1964); http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.1918933) is shown in the following equation, where $f_r$ is the frequency of the $r^{\\mathrm{th}}$ partial, $f_0$ is the fundamental frequency and $B$ is the inharmonicity coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:fletcher}\n",
    " f_r = rf_{0}\\sqrt{(1+Br^{2})}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will measure the inharmonicity in a piano note using the harmonic model. With the estimates of the fundamental frequency $f_0$ and of the harmonics $\\mathbf{f}_{est}$ for a frame $l$, we can obtain a measure of inharmonicity as, \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:inharm}\n",
    "I[l]=\\frac{1}{R}\\overset{R}{\\underset{r=1}{\\sum}}\\left(\\frac{\\left|f_{\\mathrm{est}}^{r}[l]-r\\, f_{0}[l]\\right|}{r}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the number of harmonics (the number of harmonics being used to compute inharmonicity), $f_0[l]$ is the fundamental frequency estimated at the frame $l$ and $f_{\\mathrm{est}}^{r}[l]$ is the estimated frequency of the $r^{\\mathrm{th}}$ harmonic at the frame. Note that the first harmonic is the fundamental. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then compute the mean inharmonicity in a specific time region between the frame indexes $l_1$ and $l_2$ as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "I_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\frac{1}{l_2-l_1+1}\\overset{l_2}{\\underset{l=l_1}{\\sum}}I[l]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "__TWM algorithm candidate selection:__ The two way mismatch algorithm implemented in sms-tools needs a set of $f_0$ candidates to start with. An easy choice of candidates are the peaks of the magnitude spectrum within a specific range of frequencies. However, this way of choosing $f_0$ candidates fails when there is no peak corresponding to the true $f_0$ value. The generation of $f_0$ candidates can be done better by also including the sub-harmonics of the peak frequencies as $f_0$ candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Searching numpy arrays:__ Numpy provides an efficient way to search for a specific element(s) of an array that satisfy a given condition. You can use `np.where()` in such cases. e.g. Given a numpy array `a = array([ 0.9193727 ,  0.6359579 ,  0.8335968 ,  0.20568055,  0.13874869])` and you want to extract the indexes of elements less than 0.5, you can use `np.where(a<0.5)[0]`. The function returns `array([3, 4])` corresponding the indexes of the elements in `a` less than 0.5. "

    "3. You should then apply a deviation threshold, `stdThsld`, to determine if the current frame belongs to a stable note region or not. Since we are interested in the stable note regions, the standard deviation of the previous `winStable` number of `f0` samples (including the current sample) should be less than `stdThsld` i.e. use the current sample and `winStable-1` previous samples. Ignore the first `winStable-1` samples in this computation.\n",

    "## Part 4 - Improving the implementation of the two way mismatch f0 estimation algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to improve the implementation of the two way mismatch algorithm used for fundamental frequency estimation. There is no definite answer for this question. The main purpose of this part is to understand the limitations of the current implementation of the TWM algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should directly modify the core functions that implement the TWM algorithm and that are copied here. Hence, you just need to modify the functions in this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating fundamental frequency from an audio signal is still a challenging and unsolved problem. By now you might have realized that many times the performance of the TWM `f0` estimation algorithm falls short of the expectations. There can be a systematic explanation for the scenarios where TWM fails for specific categories or characteristics of the sounds. Some of the known scenarios where the current implementation of the TWM algorithm fails to estimate a correct fundamental frequency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Missing fundamental frequency: For many sounds the fundamental frequency component is very low and therefore during the spectral peak picking step we do not obtain any peak corresponding to the `f0`. Since the TWM algorithm implemented in sms-tools considers only the detected spectral peaks as the `f0` candidates, we do not get any candidate corresponding to the `f0`. This causes `f0` estimation to fail. For example, such a scenario is encountered in low pitched vocal sounds.\n",
    "2) Pseudo-harmonicity in the sound: Many instruments, such as piano, exhibit some deviation from perfect harmonicity wherein their harmonic partials are not perfectly located at integral multiples of the fundamental frequency. Since the TWM algorithm computes error function assuming that the harmonic locations are at integral multiples, its performance is poorer when such deviations exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we propose to work on these two scenarios. Go to freesound and download sound examples of low pitched vocal sounds and of piano. Run current implementation of TMW to identify the limitations and propose improvements to the code in order to obtain better `f0` estimation for those two particular scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core TWM algorithm is implemented in the function `TWM_p()`, which takes in an array of `f0` candidates and detect the candidate that has the lowest error. `TWM_p()` is called by `f0Twm()`, which generates `f0` candidates `(f0c = np.argwhere((pfreq>minf0) & (pfreq<maxf0))[:,0])`. This function also implements a memory based prunning of the `f0` candidates. If the `f0` contour is found to be stable (no drastic transitions across frames) then only the `f0` candidates close to the stable `f0` value are retained. `f0Twm()` is called for every audio frame by `f0Detection()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the code suplied, which calls `f0Detection()` for estimating `f0` and plots the `f0` contour on top of the spectrogram of the sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "TIP: An identified limitation of the current implementation for the case of low vocal sounds is that it can only find `f0` if there is a peak present in the magnitude spectrum. A possible improvement is to generate additional `f0` candidates from the identified peaks. Another identified limitation for the case of piano sounds is the assumption of perfect harmonicity. For these sounds you can think of modifying the generation of the ideal harmonic series that is computed in the code, incorporating the typical deviation from harmonicity encountered in piano sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Before you start making changes in the TWM implementation make sure you have reached the best possible performance that can be achieved by tuning the analysis parameters. If the analysis parameters are inappropriately set, it is not completely meaningful to just improve the TWM implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain the integrity of the sms-tools package for future assignments, please make changes only to the functions in this file and not the other files in sms-tools.\n",
