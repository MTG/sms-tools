    "# Exercise 10-1: Music piece combining sound transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to extend what you did in Exercise 8 by having no limitations on the sounds used and the analysis models and transformations applied. This is an exercise to be creative and make some interesting music. The end result should be a short music piece (about a minute long) combining various transformed sounds using the tools explained in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In A8, you explored some transformations using the HPS model, but there were many limitations in that assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You used a single analysis model, HPS. Now you can use any model presented in class or combinations of them.\n",
    "2. You applied just one transformation to each sound file. Now you can combine and add several transformations of the same sound.\n",
    "3. A single type of analysis and transformation was done for the whole sound. Now you can divide the sound into sections and use different analysis and transformations to each part.\n",
    "4. The transformation was applied in a single pass. Now you can perform multiple passes of the same sound through different kinds of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you can explore the potential of all the algorithms presented in class and come up with more creative transformations and combinations of them. You can combine sounds, models, and transformations, in any way you want. You can create your own mix of transformed sounds to make your own music composition! \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these transformations might require you to change and modify some code. Feel free to dig in!\n"

    "Choose several sounds from freesound.org that have a good scope for being analyzed with the techniques described in class and good potential for creative transformations. As with E8, you can even upload your own sounds to Freesound and use them in the exercise. The sounds chosen should be naturally produced (any sound that was not synthesized). e.g. acoustic instrument sounds, speech, nature sounds, and ambient sounds, to name a few. Heavily processed natural sounds are acceptable, but refrain from using them unless justified.\n",
