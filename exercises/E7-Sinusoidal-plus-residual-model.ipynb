    "# Exercise 7: Sinusoidal plus residual model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will analyze and synthesize sounds using the Harmonic plus Stochastic (HPS) model, `hpsModel.py`. There are two questions in this exercise. In the first one you will analyze a speech sound that we give and in the second one you will analyze a sound of your choice, in both cases using the HPS model. For each question, you will first describe some of the sound characteristics by listening to the sounds and visualizing their spectrogram, characteristics that should be of relevance for the analysis/synthesis with the HPS model. Then from the described characteristics you will set the appropriate values for the different analysis parameters, explaining the choices you make, and analyze and synthesize the sounds with the HPS model software.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you can use `models_GUI.py`, to experiment with the parameters easily and then use them in here. Feel free to modify the code of the model if needed and add it also here. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you with the exercise, we first give a brief description of the analysis parameters used by the HPS model function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Window type (`window`) and Window size (`M`): The choice of window size and window type has a time-frequency trade-off. Choosing a longer window helps resolve sinusoidal components that are close in frequency, but gives a poorer temporal resolution. Shorter windows track transients better, maintaining sharp onsets, but may not resolve frequency components so well. For monophonic harmonic sounds, the window size is best chosen based on the lowest value of f0 and the fastest change in pitch.\n",
    "2. FFT size (`N`): The FFT size is chosen as a power of 2 larger than the window size M. A large FFT size N, compared with M, results on an interpolated DFT spectrum and leads to better estimation of spectral peak values. However, given that the software also uses parabolic interpolation we can achieve good peak estimates with not too big FFT sizes, for example just the next power of 2 larger than M.\n",
    "3. Threshold in negative dB (`t`): The peak picking threshold is the lowest amplitude peak that will be identified. Setting a very low threshold ($<-120$dB) will take most peaks, but the threshold should be set as high as possible to minimize the presence of peaks that do not correspond to sinusoidal peaks (the window main-lobe).\n",
    "4. Maximum number of harmonics (`nH`): The maximum number of harmonics that can be detected in a harmonic sound is influenced by the brightness of the sound, but also by the sampling rate and by how low is the f0. The recording quality can also have an impact. For a compact representation, we should only capture the relevant harmonics, the ones that affect the perceptual quality of the reconstruction.\n",
    "5. Minimum f0 frequency in Hz (`minf0`) and Maximum f0 frequency in Hz (`maxf0`): The `minf0` and `maxf0` are the parameters used by the fundamental frequency detection algorithm to obtain possible `f0` candidates to be passed to the TWM algorithm. Choosing a correct range of `f0`, but the smallest possible, greatly improves the `f0` estimation by TWM algorithm, specially minimizing octave errors, which are very common in `f0` detection algorithms. You should select the values by first looking at the spectrogram of the sound and identifying the lowest and highest fundamental frequencies present.\n",
    "6.  Threshold in the f0 detection (`f0et`): This is the maximum error allowed in the TWM algorithm. If the value is too large, the algorithm might detect fundamental frequencies that might not be actually so. Instead, if is it too small, good fundamental frequencies might not be detected, returning value 0 at that frame. The smaller the value the more restrictive the algorithm behaves. A normal strategy is to start with a big value ($> 10$) and then making it smaller until we only keep what we consider to be the relevant f0 components, discarding the \\texttt{f0} values in the parts of the sound that do not have a clear harmonic structure.\n",
    "7. Slope of harmonic deviation (`harmDevSlope`): Slope of the harmonic deviation allowed in the estimated harmonic frequencies, compared to a perfect harmonic frequencies. If the value is 0 it means that we allow the same deviation for all harmonics, which is hard coded to \\texttt{f0}$/3$. A value bigger than 0 means that higher harmonics will be allowed to deviate more than the lower harmonics from perfect harmonicity (which is a common behaviour). It normally works better to have a value slightly bigger than 0, for example around 0.01.\n",
    "8. Minimum length of harmonics (`minSineDur`): Any harmonic track shorter, in seconds, than minSineDur will be removed. This is a good parameter for discarding harmonic tracks that are too short and thus that do not correspond to stable harmonics of the sound. Typically we put a value bigger that 0.02 seconds.\n",
    "9. Decimation factor of magnitude spectrum for stochastic analysis (`stocf`): The stochastic approximation of the residual is a decimated version of the magnitude spectrum of the residual. This leads to a compact and smooth function that approximates the magnitude spectrum of the residual at each frame. The smaller the stocf, higher the decimation will be and thus will result in a more compact representation. A value of 1 means no decimation, leaving the residual magnitude spectrum as it is. A value of 0.2 (a good starting value) will decimate the original residual magnitude spectrum by a factor of 1/5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most compact and useful representation of a sound, least number of analysis data values while maintaining the sound quality in the synthesis, will be obtained by using a high t, a small `nH`, a small decimation factor for stochastic analysis, stocf, and by succeeding in detecting only the harmonics they are perceptually relevant. The values of `nH`, `minf0` and `maxf0` should be chosen by first visualizing the spectrogram of the sound with a large enough window size. There is usually a range of all parameter values for which we get a good reconstruction. Also the analysis parameters are not independent of each other and hence they need to be considered together. For testing if the detection of the harmonics have been done correctly (and for improving it) it is very useful to perform the Harmonic plus Residual analysis/synthesis (HPR model) using the same parameters and listen to the residual component for possible artifacts resulting from the harmonic analysis."
